    content: `Linear helps streamline software projects, sprints, tasks, and bug tracking. Here's how to get started.

    First, understand your team's structure. Do you need a Kanban board? Epics? Teams and cycles?
    
    Next, import your current tasks from tools like Jira, Trello, or GitHub. Linear makes this migration smooth and accurate.
    
    Set up your workspace with clearly defined labels, team members, and priorities. Create custom workflows to suit your team.
    
    Use keyboard shortcuts, filters, and integrations (like Slack, GitHub) to speed up your workflow.
    
    Linear isn’t just for task tracking — it's a productivity multiplier when used right.`,

    content: `Starting your day with a solid morning routine sets the tone for success.

    Begin with hydration — drink water to wake up your system. Spend 5–10 minutes journaling or planning your day.
    
    Incorporate light physical activity like stretching, yoga, or a short walk. This increases blood flow and focus.
    
    Avoid screens for the first 30 minutes. Try meditation or deep breathing to ground yourself mentally.
    
    With consistency, your morning routine becomes automatic — and the positive impact on your productivity becomes clear.`,

    Start by choosing simple recipes with 5–6 ingredients. Focus on proteins (chicken, tofu), carbs (rice, quinoa), and veggies.
    
    Set aside 1–2 hours on weekends to cook in bulk. Use containers to divide meals into portions for the week.
    
    Use sauces and spices to mix up flavors even with the same base ingredients.
    
    With just a little planning, you'll save time, reduce food waste, and stay consistent with healthy eating.`,

    To stay productive, create a dedicated workspace. Avoid working from bed or the couch.
    
    Use techniques like Pomodoro (25 min focus, 5 min break) to manage attention span.
    
    Keep a to-do list visible and start each day by setting 3 main priorities.
    
    Reduce distractions: silence non-work notifications, and set boundaries with people in your space.
    
    Remote work thrives when you have structure and clear habits.`,

    Start with just 5 minutes each morning or evening. Write freely about your thoughts, emotions, or what you’re grateful for.
    
    Use prompts like “What am I worried about?” or “What do I want to focus on today?”
    
    Over time, journaling helps identify patterns in your behavior and thoughts.
    
    Many people report improved mood, better decision-making, and less mental clutter through daily writing.`,

    Every hour, stand up and perform 2–3 light stretches. Neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, and standing hamstring stretches work well.
    
    Wrist circles and seated spinal twists can also help.
    
    Better yet, set reminders or use apps to prompt you to stretch.
    
    Your body (and brain) will thank you with better posture, circulation, and focus.`,

    content: `React Hooks let you use state and side effects without writing class components.

    useState is used to manage local state in functional components.
    Example:
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect is used to perform side effects like API calls, subscriptions, or DOM updates.
    Example:
    useEffect(() => {
      // code here runs on mount or update
    }, [dependency]);

    Hooks simplify React logic and make code cleaner and more reusable.`,

    content: `Conditional rendering lets you show elements based on logic.

    The ternary operator is great for toggling content:
    {isLoggedIn ? <Logout /> : <Login />}

    You can also use && to render if true:
    {show && <Component />}

    These methods keep your UI responsive and dynamic, based on app state.
    
    Mastering these basics makes your React components more flexible.`,

    It's about being intentional with what you own, what you do, and how you spend your time.

    Many find that minimalism brings a deep sense of freedom and clarity.`,
